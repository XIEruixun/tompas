# τompas
τompas (TEM On-line Multi-Purpose Analyzing System) is a free acnd integrated software tool to perform on-line crystallographic analysis in TEM experiments. By using sample holder tilt angles, τompas can simulate pole figures, Kikuchi patterns and features' projections simultaneously, providing an intuitive and comprehensive view of the sample crystallography. These simulations are further used to navigate sample tilting, and instantly interpret experimental Kikuchi patterns and images by image matching, giving self-consistent indices of features and crystal orientations. Integrating these functions with mouse operations in a user-friendly graphical interface, τompas can efficiently solve daily problems in conventional TEM experiments. In addition, τompas is distributed as a small cross-platform program, making it possible to be installed on a microscope computer to cooperate with other tools.
